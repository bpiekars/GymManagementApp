# How to Run Gym Management Application
## CIS 454 Group 11 Project 1

This is a C# Wiondows Form Application that requires the Windows version of Visual Studio in order to run properly.
To run the program properly, you can either run it directly from Visual Studio (recommended) or open the .exe. directly by opening the ToyProject folder, navigating to the Debug folder, and launching GymManagementAppl.exe.

NOTE: This app may no longer work properly since the AWS database is now inactive.
